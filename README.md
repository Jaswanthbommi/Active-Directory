## Active Directory - Home Lab
Hello everyone, before we delve into this lab, we need to understand what Active Directory is.<br>

Active Directory is like a master organizer created by Microsoft for computer networks. It serves as a central hub that keeps track of crucial information in a network, such as who is using it, available resources, and how to maintain overall security. Think of it as a giant digital filing cabinet that stores details about users (individuals utilizing the network), groups (clusters of users with similar access), and the rules ensuring everything stays secure.<br>

In simpler terms, it's the system boss that helps manage who can do what on a network, ensuring everything remains organized, secure, and user-friendly.<br>

Now that we have an understanding of Active Directory, let's proceed to the next steps. These are the main tasks we'll tackle in the lab: <br>
- Active Directory & VM Installation <br>
- Remote Access Server (RAS) & Network Services <br>
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) <br>
- User Account Management via PowerShell <br>
- Understanding Active Directoryâ€™s Core <br>
- Create a Windows 10 Enterprise VM, Rename, and Join the Domain <br>
- Verify Login Credentials <br>
